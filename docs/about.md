# About Us

## Tea Weight Scale System Research Project

The **Tea Weight Scale System Prototype** is a research-focused project aimed at addressing inefficiencies in tea harvesting and collection through automation, data analytics, and real-time data management. By combining innovative hardware and software technologies, our system enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the tea collection process, creating value for both plantation workers and managers.

### Mission
To develop and implement a reliable, automated tea collection system that reduces manual errors, increases operational efficiency, and provides real-time insights to improve decision-making in tea plantations.

### Vision
We envision a future where tea plantations operate seamlessly with the aid of technology, fostering sustainability, productivity, and better working conditions for tea pluckers, supervisors, and plantation managers. Our research-driven approach ensures that we build solutions that benefit all stakeholders.
