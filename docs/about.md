# About Us

## IoT Piano Visualizer Project

The **IoT Piano Visualizer** is an innovative project that integrates hardware and software technologies to create an interactive piano learning experience. By combining real-time visual feedback with user performance tracking, this system enhances the process of learning piano, making it more engaging and effective for learners of all levels. The system utilizes an RGB LED strip to display corresponding notes as they are played, helping learners improve their timing and accuracy.

### Mission
To provide a dynamic, interactive learning environment for piano students that incorporates visual feedback, real-time performance tracking, and data analytics to accelerate skill development.

### Vision
We envision a future where music education is enriched by the seamless integration of technology, making learning more accessible, interactive, and enjoyable. Our goal is to revolutionize the way people learn piano by merging traditional music education with cutting-edge IoT technologies.
