# Introduction

The **Tea Weight Scale System Prototype** is designed to automate and streamline the process of weighing harvested tea in plantations. This system integrates modern technology with agriculture, allowing for precise weight measurements and real-time data management, making the tea collection process more efficient and error-free.

## Purpose of the Project

Tea plantations face challenges in accurately measuring and recording the weight of tea leaves plucked by workers. Traditional manual methods are prone to errors, delays, and inefficiencies. The **Tea Weight Scale System** aims to solve these issues by introducing a technology-driven solution that ensures:
- **Accurate weight measurement** using high-precision load cells.
- **Seamless data transmission** from the field to a centralized database.
- **Efficient record-keeping** for tea pluckers and supervisors, reducing manual paperwork and minimizing errors.

## Key Objectives

The system is designed to:
- **Measure and display the weight** of harvested tea using a load cell and digital scale.
- **Verify and confirm the weight** by a supervisor before storing the data.
- **Store the data** in a centralized database for easy tracking and reporting.
- **Provide real-time access** to tea weight data, allowing for faster decision-making and improved productivity.
  
## Project Goals

- **Automation**: Automate the process of tea weight measurement and data entry.
- **Accuracy**: Achieve high precision in weight measurement to ensure fairness in payments for tea pluckers.
- **Efficiency**: Minimize delays in the tea collection process by digitizing weight records.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple, intuitive web-based interface for supervisors and workers to interact with the system.

## System Overview

The **Tea Weight Scale System Prototype** consists of three key components:

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - A high-precision load cell connected to an HX711 amplifier for measuring the weight of tea.
   - An LCD display for showing the current weight to supervisors.
   - A push button for confirming the weight after verification.

2. **Web Interface**:
   - A responsive web-based frontend built with **Vite.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
   - Features for entering employee IDs, displaying tea weights, and saving records to the database.

3. **Backend & Database**:
   - A **PHP**-based backend that handles data transmission and storage.
   - A **MySQL** database to store tea weight records, allowing for efficient data retrieval and reporting.

## Benefits of the System

1. **Accuracy**: Ensures accurate weighing and real-time recording of tea weights.
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces manual entry errors and speeds up the tea collection process.
3. **Data Integrity**: Centralized storage of weight records ensures data is accurate and can be accessed for audits or reports.
4. **Scalability**: The system can be scaled to multiple tea collection sites or extended with additional features like reporting, analysis, and worker management.
